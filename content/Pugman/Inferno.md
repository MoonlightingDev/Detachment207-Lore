----------------------
The operation’s name reflects the intensity of the mission. The industrial park, now a hub of insurgent activity, is seen as the heart of their operations in Fallujah. By striking hard and fast, the goal is to reduce this stronghold to ashes and leave no room for insurgents to rebuild. The operation is designed to send a clear message: there is no refuge for those who threaten the stability of this region.


This mission represents more than a tactical clearance. It is a campaign to deny insurgents their stronghold and to remind them that their safe havens are fleeting. The industrial park has been a source of propaganda for EN forces, boasting of their resilience. Operation Inferno will turn their stronghold into a graveyard of failed ambitions.

Intel suggests the insurgents have fortified their positions with a false sense of invulnerability. Reports of their command structure relying on local sympathizers to provide intel and resources highlight the need for a swift and overwhelming response. By isolating and destroying their operational hub, we cut off the head of the snake and disrupt the entire network across the AO.




Operation 1:

After the US-led assault on Fallujah, most Al-Qaeda forces cleared out of the area and went underground. In recent days the once-silent communication lines have sparked back up, leading Detachment 207’s training exercise with the Spanish to be canceled and for them to be redeployed to the sandbox.
  

EN Forces are known to deploy IEDs to combat friendly vehicles, but have not been seen to utilise IEDs for anti-personnel purposes.

#### **Mission Summary**

Detachment 207 was tasked with clearing remaining guerrilla forces in Fallujah following a resurgence in enemy communication activity. The operation was conducted in two phases: reconnaissance and intel gathering (Phase 1) and targeted clearance of insurgent strongholds (Phase 2). Patrols were based out of Patrol Base Tiger (Alpha) and Patrol Base Lion (Bravo and Charlie) with supporting elements from Foxtrot, Ghost, and Hawkeye.

---

### **Phase 1: Reconnaissance and Patrol**

**Objective:** Establish patrol bases, conduct reconnaissance patrols, and gather intelligence on insurgent activity in the Area of Operations (AO).

- **Alpha Team (Patrol Base Tiger):**
    
    - Secured PB Tiger without resistance.
    - Conducted daily foot and motorized patrols within the Alpha Sector.
    - Notable engagement: Alpha’s foot patrol identified and avoided an EN-planted IED targeting vehicles along a high-traffic route. Ghost assets confirmed no insurgent personnel nearby.
    - Alpha reported signs of sporadic insurgent movement on the southern boundary of their sector. This intel was forwarded to Hawkeye for confirmation.
- **Bravo Team (Patrol Base Lion):**
    
    - Encountered minor resistance during the securing of PB Lion. Bravo neutralized a small insurgent cell using coordinated fire support from Reaper elements.
    - Bravo patrols identified EN weapons caches concealed in abandoned buildings. These caches included small arms and IED components.
    - Charlie elements collaborated with Bravo to clear potential routes for logistics movements.
- **Charlie & Reaper (Patrol Base Lion):**
    
    - Conducted coordinated patrols in the Charlie Sector. Reaper provided static defense of PB Lion and QRF support for Charlie patrols.
    - A key intel find involved an abandoned EN communication hub. Documents recovered pointed to an EN safehouse near the city’s northwestern sector.
- **Ghost (Overwatch):**
    
    - Positioned atop a central high-rise with a clear view of both Alpha and Bravo sectors.
    - Detected and reported insurgent movements, enabling friendly patrols to avoid ambushes.
    - Provided real-time intelligence on suspected EN observation posts, one of which was neutralized by Foxtrot.
- **Hawkeye (ISR):**
    
    - Conducted daily drone reconnaissance, identifying potential insurgent staging areas and safehouses.
    - Provided actionable ISR for Bravo’s engagement at PB Lion and detected enemy movements that Alpha avoided.
    - Nighttime operations revealed movement near an abandoned factory complex. This became a target for Phase 2.

---

### **Phase 2: Targeted Clearance**

**Objective:** Conduct operations to eliminate insurgent strongholds based on gathered intelligence.

- **Insurgent Factory Clearance (Northwest Sector):**
    
    - Tasked to Bravo and Reaper elements with support from Hawkeye.
    - Bravo entered the compound via motorized convoy while Reaper held an external perimeter.
    - Contact initiated upon entry: insurgents defended the site with small arms and RPGs. Hawkeye confirmed no civilians in the area, enabling precision fire from Reaper’s heavy weapons.
    - After a 45-minute engagement, the factory was cleared, yielding critical EN documents and weaponry.
- **IED Neutralization:**
    
    - Foxtrot successfully disarmed three roadside IEDs near PB Lion. These were positioned to disrupt patrol and logistics movements.
    - Daisy proved vital in securing the patrol base’s perimeter, detecting and engaging a lone insurgent scout attempting to infiltrate.
- **Urban Engagement (Southern Sector):**
    
    - Alpha conducted a deliberate clearance of an EN safehouse identified during Phase 1.
    - Contact involved five armed insurgents who were neutralized without friendly casualties.
    - Recovered materials suggested the safehouse was used to coordinate recent insurgent operations.
      
      
Detachment 207 achieving its objectives while minimizing casualties and ensuring valuable intel was recovered. Further operations will solidify these gains and eliminate the remaining insurgent threat.


Operation 2
**Operational Context:**  
Fallujah has long been a flashpoint in the campaign against insurgent forces. Following a resurgence of enemy communication activity and intelligence suggesting renewed insurgent mobilization, Detachment 207 has been ordered to deliver a decisive blow. The industrial park—a sprawling complex of warehouses, factories, and supply depots—has become a key logistical hub for enemy forces. Securing this area is critical to crippling their operational capabilities and preventing further escalation.

Recent ISR indicates the industrial park has been fortified, with enemy personnel using elevated positions and concealed firing points to monitor approaches. Command expects heavy resistance within the park, including possible vehicle-borne IEDs (VBIEDs) or pre-planted traps to disrupt our advance. EN reinforcements may attempt to cross from the western sectors via two main bridges, which are key logistical choke points.

The stakes are high: failure to clear and secure this AO risks allowing insurgents to regroup, threatening the stability of the entire eastern Fallujah region.

### **Phase 1: Hard Clearance of the Industrial Park**

**Ingress and Staging:**

- **1-1 Platoon** and **Foxtrot** will convoy from FOB Orion along the Eastern MSR, bypassing urban hotspots, to **Ingress Point Golf**. ISR from **Hawkeye** will monitor the route for enemy movement and ambushes.
- At the ingress point, 1-1 Platoon will dismount and proceed through pre-cleared areas to their designated **attack points**. Sections will coordinate movements to maintain stealth.

**Section Objectives:**

- **Alpha Section:**
    
    - Enter the industrial park **500m west of Charlie**, clearing southward between the **green and blue control lines**.
    - Maintain flexibility to support **Bravo Section** if they encounter resistance.
    - Priority is securing a central foothold within the park to enable sustained operations.
- **Bravo Section:**
    
    - Enter from their designated attack marker, clearing southward and staying west of the **green control line**.
    - Tasked with securing the industrial park’s **western edge**, neutralizing potential flanking threats, and clearing suspected supply depots.
- **Charlie Section:**
    
    - Enter the industrial park **500m east of Alpha**, clearing the **eastern edge** and securing firing positions to interdict enemy reinforcements.
    - Establish a **Support by Fire (SBF)** position within the park to support all sectors.
    - If Alpha encounters delays or heavy resistance, Charlie will assist in clearing their sector.

**Reaper Tasking (within Charlie):**

- Deploy heavy weapons to a suitable SBF position to dominate key avenues of approach.
- Provide suppressive fire on fortified enemy positions or vehicle threats within the park.

### **Phase 2: Sector-by-Sector Clearance of the AO**

**Objective:** After securing the industrial park, all sections will transition to a **soft clearance** of the AO, advancing westward toward the **two bridges** while maintaining control of key terrain.

- **Sector Assignments:**
    
    - Sections will be assigned specific **numbered sectors** based on their position at the conclusion of Phase 1.
    - Areas marked **in red** will require hard clearance due to suspected enemy activity or strategic significance.
- **Foxtrot Tasking:**
    
    - Establish a **forward Patrol Base** in the **northwest corner** of the industrial park.
    - Manage logistics, redeployments, and OPDEM support for all platoon elements during Phase 2.
    - Daisy will remain mobile, accompanying clearing teams along the **MSR** for support.
- **Hawkeye Tasking:**
    
    - Expand ISR coverage to include western sectors and bridge crossings.
    - Provide real-time intel on enemy reinforcements or ambushes, enabling proactive counteraction.
    - Deploy **Apache** for precision air support, emphasizing urban-appropriate tactics (gun over missiles).
- **Ghost Tasking:**
    
    - Select a suitable overwatch position in the **western AO** to provide sniper support and advance warning of enemy movements.
    - If enemy reinforcements utilize the **two bridges**, Ghost will conduct an **underwater demolition mission** to neutralize these crossings.
      
### **Endstate**

- The **industrial park** is cleared of insurgent forces, with all remaining logistical hubs and fortified positions destroyed.
- AO sectors west of the industrial park are systematically cleared, ensuring control over the **two main bridges** or rendering them unusable to enemy forces.
- A **forward Patrol Base** is established in the northwest industrial park, serving as a staging area for future operations.
- Intel gathered during the operation confirms significant insurgent activity regrouping in the **southern part of Fallujah**, particularly in densely populated urban zones and rural outskirts.
- Enemy forces, though weakened, appear to be consolidating their presence in the south, suggesting a strategic shift to more entrenched and guerrilla-style defenses.

**Commander's Intent for Follow-On Operations:**  
Operation Inferno has paved the way for a broader campaign to reclaim southern Fallujah. The success of this mission provides a launching point for future assaults, leveraging the industrial park as a secure base of operations.

The next phase will focus on pushing into the **southern districts**, dismantling remaining insurgent cells, and establishing full control over the city. Expect increasingly desperate resistance as EN forces are forced to defend their remaining strongholds.

**Prepare for further tasking:** The fire that began with Operation Inferno will now spread, consuming the enemy’s last bastion in Fallujah’s southern districts.
