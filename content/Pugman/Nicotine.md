#### **Overview:**

Operation Nicotine was a decisive and highly coordinated push to neutralize the remaining CSAT forces in the region, including key enemy positions on Stratis. Despite the mountainous terrain and expected resistance, Detachment 207 successfully executed the three-phased assault, dismantling CSAT’s Mediterranean Command and crippling their operational capability.

The success of this operation paves the way for further consolidation of the region, allowing NATO forces to establish a permanent presence and deny CSAT the ability to regroup.

### **Phase 1: Assault on Camp Maxwell (Obj Echo) and Air Station Mike-26 (Obj Golf)**

**Camp Maxwell:**

- **Alpha and Charlie Sections** executed a textbook dual-pronged assault on the compound.
    - **Alpha** engaged and cleared the **western compound**, encountering sporadic but well-entrenched resistance. The team utilized suppressive fire to neutralize fortified positions, minimizing casualties.
    - **Charlie** faced resistance at the **helipad** and the smaller eastern compound. Despite heavy small arms fire, Charlie secured the area with coordinated fire and a swift breach.
- Minimal casualties were sustained, and enemy forces were completely neutralized, leaving the camp secure by 0930 local time.

**Air Station Mike-26:**

- **Bravo Section** led the assault from the southern approach, flanked by **Reaper** and supported by **Daisy** on the MSR.
    - **Bravo** breached the southern perimeter, encountering CSAT forces entrenched in the command towers. Reaper neutralized elevated threats, clearing the way for Bravo’s assault teams to secure the site.
    - **Daisy** provided overwatch and fire support to suppress enemy reinforcements approaching from the east.
- The air station was secured by 1015 local time, and intel recovered included updated CSAT defensive plans for future objectives.

### **Phase 2: Assault on Camp Rogain (Obj Hotel)**

- **Alpha and Charlie Sections** advanced to the **eastern side** of the hill, coordinating a joint assault on the camp.
    - Alpha engaged from the **northeastern rocks**, drawing the majority of enemy fire. Heavy resistance was encountered, including CSAT sharpshooters and light vehicle patrols. Despite this, Alpha’s precision and use of terrain ensured the camp’s defenses were overwhelmed.
    - **Charlie** secured the MSR to the south, clearing obstacles and engaging a QRF convoy attempting to reinforce the camp. Once the road was secure, Charlie joined Alpha to complete the clearance.
- **Bravo Section** approached from the west, moving through the valley with half of **Reaper**. They successfully intercepted and neutralized additional QRF forces attempting to flank the objective.
    - **Reaper’s blocking force** (positioned south of Obj Papa) proved instrumental in halting enemy reinforcements from the northern sectors.
- Obj Hotel was secured by 1215 local time. Enemy command structures were dismantled, and key supplies were destroyed.

### **Phase 3: Assault on Remaining Objectives (Papa, Kilo, Quebec)**

**Obj Papa:**

- Bravo Section, reinforced by Reaper, advanced via the northern MSR. Despite encountering a well-fortified compound, they successfully breached and cleared the site with minimal delay. Enemy forces attempted to counterattack but were repelled by coordinated suppressive fire and mortar strikes directed by **Hawkeye ISR.**

**Obj Kilo:**

- Assets from Obj Hotel consolidated and pushed southwest toward Obj Kilo. Resistance here was lighter than expected, likely due to the elimination of reinforcements earlier in the operation. The site was cleared swiftly, with no significant casualties.

**Obj Quebec (Stratis Airbase):**

- The final assault was launched by the **entire platoon**, supported by **Daisy** and ISR from **Hawkeye.**
    - **Alpha and Bravo** sections breached the northern and western perimeters, facing moderate resistance from entrenched defenders.
    - **Charlie and Reaper** provided suppressive fire and neutralized armored threats, including a CSAT APC attempting to reinforce the airfield.
- Ghost successfully reconnoitered the airbase and identified key enemy positions, allowing for precision strikes by Hawkeye to weaken defenses before the assault.
- By 1530 local time, the airbase and surrounding area were secured. Enemy command assets were eliminated, and captured intel confirmed CSAT’s retreat from the region.

### **Key Successes:**

- **Coordination Across Units:** Seamless execution of multi-phased objectives ensured minimal delays and high operational efficiency.
- **ISR and Recon Effectiveness:** Hawkeye and Ghost provided real-time intelligence that was instrumental in neutralizing QRF threats and targeting high-value assets.
- **Minimal Casualties:** Effective planning and execution resulted in low friendly casualties, despite the challenging terrain and heavily fortified objectives.

### **Challenges and Lessons Learned:**

1. **QRF Timing:** Enemy reinforcements from Obj Papa to Obj Hotel arrived sooner than anticipated, requiring rapid redeployment of assets to contain the threat. Future operations should emphasize early disruption of potential QRF routes.
2. **Urban Operations Preparation:** Obj Quebec revealed the need for more comprehensive training in urban warfare tactics, particularly when engaging entrenched enemy forces in dense infrastructure.
3. **Communication in Mountainous Terrain:** Radio interference in the AO caused delays in some tasking updates. Additional comms support should be deployed for future mountainous operations.

### **Endstate and Forward Operations:**

Operation Nicotine has effectively dismantled CSAT’s Mediterranean Command and eliminated their ability to operate within the Stratis region. However, captured intel suggests CSAT forces have regrouped further south in **Altis**, consolidating their strength for a potential counteroffensive.
