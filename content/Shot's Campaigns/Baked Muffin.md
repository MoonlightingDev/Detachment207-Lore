Subject: Missing You
Dear Emily,
I hope this email finds you well. I've been thinking about you a lot lately and wanted to take a moment to write. Being away from home has been tough, but knowing that you're there waiting for me makes it easier to get through each day.
It's been 8 weeks since I last saw you, and I miss you more every day. The nights here are long, but the thought of your smile keeps me going. I remember our last day together, how we laughed and talked for hours. 2 more months to go, and I will be back home. I can't wait for that day to come.
Last night, as I lay under the stars, I thought about our plans for the future. I know there are 6 things we promised to do together once I'm back. Your letters are a lifeline to me, and I read them over and over. 4 days ago, I received your latest one, and it brought tears to my eyes.
Please take care of yourself and know that you are always in my heart. I can't wait to be back home and hold you in my arms again.
With all my love,
James Anderson
Sergeant, 3rd Battalion

Subject: Update on Recent Deployment
Dear Emily,
I hope you're doing well. I wanted to share a quick update from my latest deployment. Things are moving at a steady pace here, and although the work can be challenging, I'm holding up just fine.
Yesterday, I was on patrol and couldn't help but think of you. It’s been 5 weeks since we last spoke on video, and I’m counting down the days until we can talk again. The nights are starting to get colder here, and it's during these quiet moments that I miss you the most. But we push through. I've met some incredible people in the unit— 7 of us have formed a close group, and they’ve become like brothers to me.
We recently had a short break, and I spent 3 hours reading your last letter. It made me feel like you were right here with me. I find comfort in those little things that remind me of you, no matter how far apart we are.
Looking forward to being home in a couple of months—hopefully by the time winter hits, I’ll be back with you, where I belong. I think of you every day, and 8 times out of 10, it's what keeps me going. Please keep writing to me; your letters mean the world.
All my love,
James Anderson
Sergeant, 3rd Battalion
