Under the cloak of night, our unit's convoy stealthily traverses the rugged terrain of the Anizay green zone. Using clandestine tactics, we secure safe passage by greasing palms and striking deals with local farmers and authorities to ensure our movements go unnoticed by the unsuspecting populace. As dawn breaks, we reach our destination: the abandoned British FOB Nauzad. Despite its dilapidated state, this strategic outpost serves as our base of operations on the edge of the safe green zone. With limited space and time, we swiftly begin the deployment of our assets, setting the stage for our imminent operation against the forces of the ION corporatio

-------------------

Greetings, operatives. Our latest mission, codenamed "Oiled Mustache," saw 207 execute a daring nighttime assault on the northern half of the green zone in Anizey. Our primary objectives included rescuing civilian workers held captive by ION Corporation, disrupting enemy operations, and seizing control of strategic locations.

Throughout the operation, our forces successfully rescued the captive workers, obtaining valuable intelligence on ION's activities in the region. We struck multiple enemy hard points, including ammunition depots, living quarters, and listening posts, breaking the corporation's hold on the green zone.

Forward observers played a crucial role in identifying and neutralizing SAM sites protecting the airport. With their destruction, 207 launched a full-scale assault on the airport, overcoming fierce resistance and repelling enemy air support to secure control of this vital asset.

In addition to our primary objectives, we uncovered several key pieces of information:
ION Corporation has been bribing local warlords to maintain control of the green zone. With their support now in question, we must work to gain the trust of the locals.
A large force of over 300 ION personnel was redirected away from the local airfield following our successful operation.
Civilians working at the oil fields are being exposed to dangerous substances, making them liabilities to the corporation.
Surprisingly, ION Corp radio jammers were not deployed against us during the operation, raising questions about their intentions.
We discovered a cache of military drones hidden in a bunker at the airport, awaiting decryption by HQ for potential use.

Moving forward, we must leverage this newfound intelligence to further disrupt ION Corporation's operations and bolster our own efforts to secure the region. Stay vigilant, operatives, and prepare for the challenges ahead.

In a stunning display of valor and determination, the valiant soldiers of 207 delivered a crushing blow to Ion Corp's operations in the region during the fourth mission of Operation Oiled Mustache. Spearheaded by Reaper Assault, the armored units of Ion Corp found their fuel reserves drained by the strategic maneuvers of 207 forces. Meanwhile, Alpha and Bravo squads engaged in fierce urban combat, bravely fighting street-to-street to liberate the city from Ion Corp's oppressive grip. Despite the enemy's ruthless tactics, 207 succeeded in clearing the town without a single civilian casualty, demonstrating their unwavering commitment to protecting innocent lives.

Simultaneously, a coordinated airborne and mechanized assault on the town of Gorqan proved instrumental in further weakening Ion Corp's hold on the region. While facing heavy resistance, 207 units managed to disrupt enemy reinforcements and secure vital objectives. Despite the loss of local police forces to Ion Corp's aggression, 207 forces remained resolute, eliminating the enemy garrison and thwarting their nefarious plans.

As the dust settled, 207 forces uncovered a disturbing revelationâ€”an underground cache of ammunition being clandestinely emptied by Ion Corp troops. Undeterred by this discovery, 207 pressed forward with a multipronged assault on the dig site and storage facility, overcoming Ion Corp's desperate attempts at reinforcement by air. The successful recovery of all four containment devices marked a significant victory for 207, leading to speculation about the true intentions of Ion Corp and the origins of these mysterious devices. With these questions lingering in the air, 207 remains steadfast in its pursuit of justice and liberation in the face of adversity.
